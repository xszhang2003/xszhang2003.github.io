# Other Activities

### Joint TDLI and INPAC Summer School in Particle Physics 2023

The school covers recent experimental developments in dark matter, neutrino, collider and muon physics where significant progress has been achieved.

### Tsung-Dao Lee Institute Winter Camp of Astrophysics

Studied the method of estimating the mass of a boson star, and numerically predict the upper bound of the mass using shooting method of ODE. And understood the theory knowledge about axions.

### Taishan Seminar

I have been actively participating in the Taishan Seminar, a long-term student-led study group, since its early stages. As a contributor, I frequently deliver lectures on various subjects, including quantum field theory, quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, and other cutting-edge topics.
